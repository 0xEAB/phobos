	"It seems to me that most of the "new" programming languages
	fall into one of two categories: Those from academia with radical
	new paradigms and those from large corporations with a focus on RAD
	and the web. Maybe it's time for a new language born out of
	practical experience implementing compilers." -- Michael

$(P The first
$(LINK2 http://d.puremagic.com/conference2007/, D Programming Language Conference)
took place in Seattle at Amazon, Aug 23..24, 2007.)

$(P
D is a systems programming language.
Its focus is on combining the power and high performance of C and C++ with
the programmer productivity of modern languages like Ruby and Python.
Special attention is given to the needs of quality assurance, documentation,
management, portability and reliability.
)

$(P The D language is statically typed and compiles directly to machine code.
It's multiparadigm, supporting many programming styles: 
imperative, object oriented, and metaprogramming. It's a member of the C 
syntax family, and its appearance is very similar to that of C++. For a 
quick comparison of the features, see
this $(LINK2 comparison.html, comparison)
of D with C, C++, C# and Java.)

$(P It is not governed by a corporate agenda or any overarching theory of
programming. The needs and contributions of the
$(LINK2 ../NewsGroup.html, D programming community) form the direction it
goes.
)

$(P There are currently two implementations, the
$(LINK2 dcompiler.html, Digital Mars DMD) package for Win32 and x86 Linux,
and the
$(LINK2 http://dgcc.sourceforge.net/, GCC D Compiler) package for
several platforms, including
$(LINK2 http://gdcwin.sourceforge.net/, Windows)
and
$(LINK2 http://gdcmac.sourceforge.net/, Mac OS X).
)

$(P A large and growing collection of D source code and projects
are at $(LINK2 http://www.dsource.org, dsource).
More links to innumerable D wikis, libraries, tools, media articles,
etc. are at $(LINK2 dlinks.html, dlinks).
